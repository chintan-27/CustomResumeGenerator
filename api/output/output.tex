\textbf{Google Chrome: \textit{When we developed Google Chrome, our goal was to redefine the web browsing experience with speed, simplicity, and security at its core. We started by building Chrome on top of the open-source Chromium project to ensure transparency and flexibility. The architecture was designed to be multiprocess-based, which means every tab, plugin, and extension runs in its own isolated process. This approach not only improved performance but also dramatically enhanced stability and security—if one tab crashes, it doesn't take down the entire browser." "For rendering web pages, we used the WebKit engine initially, later evolving into the Blink rendering engine to give us greater control over performance and feature development. JavaScript execution is powered by the V8 engine, a high-performance, just-in-time (JIT) compiler that transforms complex web apps into fast, seamless experiences. From the user’s perspective, Chrome was built to feel intuitive. The minimalist design keeps distractions to a minimum while offering powerful tools under the hood, like the Omnibox—a combination of search and address bar—to simplify interaction." "We prioritized security with features like sandboxing processes, automatic updates, and Safe Browsing to protect users from malware and phishing attacks. Performance optimizations, such as pre-rendering and efficient memory management, were key considerations to ensure the browser remained fast, even as web applications grew more demanding." "We also built a robust ecosystem around Chrome with support for extensions and progressive web apps, giving users a fully customizable experience. Developer tools (DevTools) were another major focus—helping web developers analyze performance, debug, and optimize their applications directly within the browse}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enhanced the performance of high-memory browser applications by designing scalable servers in Rust, interfacing efficiently with Solana and Orca's web application to support complex transaction processing in decentralized finance.
\item Improved blockchain data handling by developing reliable data processing pipelines, ensuring reduced latency and seamless integration with Solana's decentralized financial systems, thus advancing Orca's application capabilities in token balance analytics and real-time monitoring.
\item Streamlined database management using PostgreSQL, achieving data integrity and rapid retrieval essential for high-performance application development within Orca's async environment, while leveraging experience as a DeFi user for informed solutions in crypto-based financial systems.
